# Bayesian-Inference-covid-antibody-test

This notebook implements a Bayesian framework first proposed by [Gelman & Carpenter](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/specificity.pdf) to infer the prevalence of COVID-19 based on a Santa Clara County antibody study by [Bendavid *et al.*](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v2) using PyMC3.
